# Car Price Prediction

This project predicts **used car prices** based on several features such as brand, year, fuel type, and mileage. It involves model comparison and visual evaluation to determine the best-performing regression model.

## Key Highlights
- Performed comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
- Preprocessing steps: handling missing values, encoding, and scaling
- Trained and compared four models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Regression.
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Visualized **Actual vs Predicted** values for performance evaluation

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Results
The **best model** was selected based on RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), delivering accurate and reliable predictions of car prices.
